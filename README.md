# Stoichiometry-Calculator

# Overview
This project is a Stoichiometry Calculator designed to assist in solving chemistry dilution problems using the equation M1V1=M2V2. The calculator also handles unit conversions from mL to L and provides guidance on significant digit rounding to ensure accurate results.

# Features
* Dilution Problem Solver: Calculates missing values in the equation M1V1=M2V2 based on user input.
* Unit Conversion: Automatically converts volume from mL to L when necessary.
* Significant Digit Calculation: Determines the correct number of significant digits to round the final answer.

# Usage
To use the calculator, simply follow the prompts to input your known values. The program will solve for the unknown value and suggest how many significant digits the result should be rounded to.

# Example
If you have a final concentration (M2) and a final volume (V2) and need to find the initial concentration (M1), the calculator will guide you through the steps to get the correct answer.
